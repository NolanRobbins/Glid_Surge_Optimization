Philosophy
We are judging Systems Engineering. A winning project isn't just a slide deck or a simple API wrapper; it is a functioning system that ingests raw data, processes it locally using the DGX Spark, and produces a valuable result.

The Scoring Breakdown (100 Points Total)
1. Technical Execution & Completeness (30 Points)
    - Did they actually build a working, complex system?
        15 pts - Completeness: Does the system successfully complete the full data workflow without crashing?
        15 pts - Technical Depth: Is there significant engineering "under the hood"? Did they build a complex pipeline (e.g., Simulation, RAG, Fine-Tuning, or Custom Logic) rather than just a simple static dashboard or basic API wrapper?

2. NVIDIA Ecosystem & Spark Utility (30 Points)
    - Did they leverage the unique hardware and software provided?
        - 15 pts - The Stack: Did they use at least one major NVIDIA library/tool? (e.g., NIMs, RAPIDS, cuOpt, Modulus, NeMo Models). Note: Merely calling GPT-4 via API gets 0 points here.
        - 15 pts - The "Spark Story": Can they articulate why this runs better on a DGX Spark?
            Examples: "We used the 128GB Unified Memory to hold the video buffer and the LLM context simultaneously" or "We ran inference locally to ensure privacy/latency."

3. Value & Impact (20 Points)
    - Is the solution actually useful?
        - 10 pts - Insight Quality: Is the insight non-obvious and valuable? (e.g., "Traffic jams happen at 5 PM" is obvious. "Rain causes specific stalls on this specific ramp" is valuable).
        - 10 pts - Usability: Could a real Fire Chief, City Planner, or Factory Foreman actually use this tool to make a decision tomorrow?
4. The "Frontier" Factor (20 Points)
    - Did they push the boundaries?
        - 10 pts - Creativity: Did they combine data or models in a novel way? (e.g., Using vision models to "read" traffic maps).
        - 10 pts - Performance: Did they optimize the system for speed or scale? (e.g., "We optimized the simulation to run at 50x real-time speed").
