Port-to-Rail Surge Forecaster & Utilization Optimizer

1. Overview
This challenge focuses on building a forecasting and optimization system for the U.S. multimodal freight pipeline, specifically the flow from port → truck → rail terminals.
Teams must use real-world logistics datasets to detect surges, predict congestion, and recommend ideal rail dispatch windows within a 24–72 hour horizon.
2. Core Datasets (Required)
2a. PortWatch – Daily Port Activity (IMF)
Metrics: vessel arrivals, departures, cargo volumes, time-in-port
Purpose: detect port congestion and forecast inbound surges
Dataset: https://portwatch.imf.org/pages/data-and-methodology
2b. North American Rail Network (USDOT/FRA)
Components: rail nodes, intermodal terminals, rail line segments
Purpose: identify chokepoints, simulate routing, and model rail terminal utilization
Dataset:
Rail Lines: https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::north-american-rail-network-lines/about 
Rail Nodes: https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/usdot::north-american-rail-network-nodes/about 
2c. County-to-County Truck Travel Times (BTS/ATRI)
Metrics: median and percentile drayage travel times
Purpose: detect first-mile cycle-time stress and road-induced delays
Dataset: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/85073 
2d. Logistics Fleet Data (Kaggle)
Metrics: vehicle-level freight, cost, operational characteristics
Purpose: model drayage pressure and analyze fleet-level behavior and delays
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syednaveed05/logistics-fleet-data/data 
3. Optional Enrichment Datasets
Teams may include up to two optional datasets (maximum of six total).
Global Daily Port Activity (Kaggle) (DONE)

For benchmarking U.S. port performance against global trade activity.
AIS Vessel Tracking Data (NOAA or Kaggle) (DONE)

For predicting vessel ETAs and anticipating port surges based on inbound vessel flows.
Weather Data APIs (Open-Meteo or Visual Crossing) (DONE)

For predicting weather-driven delays affecting port operations, trucking, and rail.
4. Insight Goal
Teams must generate actionable insights, including:
24–72 hour port surge predictions
Early warnings for rail congestion or rail underutilization
First-mile drayage delay forecasting
Ideal time windows for rail dispatch
Recommended repositioning routes between nearby rail terminals
Unified real-time visualization of freight flow from port to truck to rail
5. Build Objective
Teams must produce a functioning system that:
Integrates port, truck, and rail datasets
Forecasts congestion and inbound surges
Identifies rail nodes that are likely to face chokepoints
Recommends optimal rail movement time windows
Flags anomalies across port, road, or rail network activity
Presents a clear dashboard illustrating multimodal flow dynamics
6. Expected Deliverables
A forecasting model (24–72 hour prediction window)
An optimization engine for rail utilization and scheduling
A real-time or simulated dashboard
Visualizations of port → truck → rail activity
Clear interpretability or narrative explaining model outputs
7. Summary
Participants will build an integrated system combining forecasting, anomaly detection, and logistics optimization. The goal is to improve freight velocity and reduce congestion across U.S. multimodal networks by intelligently coordinating port activity, trucking flows, and rail terminal utilization.
